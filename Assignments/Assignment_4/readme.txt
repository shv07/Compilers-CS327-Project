If you want to give only single line input then you should not give \n after that. If you give multiple lines then print \n after each line. We have tested out program on the following inputs.
g=m+n*(s-2)*(m+n)

e=(a*b)+(c/d)

m=10
n=20
s=3
g=m+n*(s-2)*(m+n)

a=10


to run
sh ./j.sh
./a.out R < in           R is # of registers we can use.
